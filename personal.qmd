Art is my hobby. I learned some photography. Then I did field research in Indonesia where I became very interested in Batik, which led me to encaustic image transfer. All the while I have been learning to draw - I now finally understand what my favorite \[artist\](https://johannahel.ga/cv/) meant when she said that everything is a sculpture, and now I am learning about watercolor.

# Photography

In 2013 I completed Certification in Photography from the \[New York Institute of Photography\](https://www.nyip.edu)

For several years photographs were my main artistic expression and you can see some of them \[here\](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jkbirnir/albums)
