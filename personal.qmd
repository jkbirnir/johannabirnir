Art is my hobby. I learned some photography. Then I did field research in Indonesia where I became very interested in Batik, which led me to encaustic image transfer. All the while I have been learning to draw - I now finally understand what my favorite [artist](https://johannahel.ga/cv/) meant when she said that everything is a sculpture.  Now I am learning about watercolor and printmaking.

In 2013 I completed Certification in Photography from the [New York Institute of Photography](https://www.nyip.edu)
