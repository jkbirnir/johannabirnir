My name is Jóhanna Kristín Birnir and I am a Professor of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland. Through the links on this page you can find information about my research and the data projects I have developed, my teaching with some tutorials, and some on my hobbies. Note that the data pages are under construction and I'm slowly adding things - so some patience is required. Thank you.
