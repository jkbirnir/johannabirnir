My name is Jóhanna Kristín Birnir and I am a Professor of Comparative Politics at the University of Maryland. Through the links on this page you can find information about my research and the data projects I have developed, my teaching with some tutorials, and some of my hobbies.  Just note that the page is under construction and I'm slowly adding thing - so some patience is required.
