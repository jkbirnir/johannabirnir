[CV](files/Birnir_CV.pdf)

I study the effect of identity (ethnicity, religion, gender) on contentious political outcomes (elections and violence), and I have done extensive fieldwork in the Andes, South-East Europe and Indonesia. Below you can find some more information about my published work and working papers.

## Monographs 

My most recent book (with Nil Satana) [Alternatives in Mobilization: Ethnicity, Religion and Political Conflict. 2022.

examines the relationship between identity (ethnicity and religion) and minority peaceful and violent political mobilization.
