## [CV](files/Birnir_CV.pdf)

I study the effect of identity (ethnicity, religion, gender) on contentious political outcomes (elections and violence), and I have done extensive fieldwork in the Andes, South-East Europe and Indonesia. Below you can find some more information about my published work and work in progress.
